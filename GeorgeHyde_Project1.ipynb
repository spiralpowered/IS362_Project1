    "# Analysis\n",
    "### Alaska\n",
    "Alaska has a total of 3,775 flights, 3,274 (86.7%) of which were on time, and 501 (13.3%) of which were delayed.\n",
    "The airline has the most activity in Seattle, totaling 2,146 (56.8%) and the least activity in San Diego, totaling 232 (6.1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AM West\n",
    "AM West has a total of 7,225 flights, nearly double the amount of Alaska. 6,438 (89.1%) of AM West's flights were on time, while 787 (10.9%) of them were delayed.\n",
    "The airline has the most activity in Phoenix, totaling 5,255 (72.7%) and the least activity in Seattle, totaling 262 (3.6%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "AM West is definitely the most consistently on time airline out of two. Its on time percentage is 2.4% higher than Alaska's, and its delay percentage is 2.4% lower, despite having much more traffic. Anybody looking to travel to any of these areas is better of flying with AM West is they are pressed for time."
